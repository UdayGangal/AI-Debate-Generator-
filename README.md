# AI-Debate-Generator
AI Debate Generator is a web-based application built using Streamlit and powered by Cohere's language model. This tool allows users to input a debate topic and participant names, and then automatically generates compelling AI-generated arguments from each participant's perspective — alternating between "in favor" and "against".

# Features

 Generate persuasive debate arguments using AI.

 Automatically assigns "in favor" / "against" stances to participants.

 Aesthetically designed with a cosmic-themed background.

 Supports between 2 to 10 participants.

Modular code separated into frontend and backend.

# How It Works
1)The user inputs a topic and a list of participant names.

2)Each participant is automatically assigned a stance (alternating between “in favor” and “against”).

3)For each stance, a tailored prompt is sent to Cohere’s language model, which returns a persuasive argument.

4)These responses are displayed beautifully on the frontend using Streamlit.
